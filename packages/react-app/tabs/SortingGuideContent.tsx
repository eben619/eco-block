      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Proper waste sorting is essential for effective recycling and environmental conservation. By separating different types of waste correctly, we can ensure that materials are reused, recycled, or disposed of in the most eco-friendly way possible. Below is a simple guide to help you sort your waste efficiently.
